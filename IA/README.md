A woman is engrossed in her tablet, browsing through the RecipeShare app. Behind her, the oven erupts with a huge flame, the blender explodes sending its contents flying, and sparks fly from electrical outlets. The scene feels more chaotic, like a comedic action sequence. The title 'RecipeShare' is prominently displayed above, with the letters giving off a fiery glow. by DALL E 3, Open AI, Accessed 25th October 2023

## Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition(Client identification)

My client is a housewife that really like cooking. She and her neighbours like sharing recipes with each other. However, they noticed that there is a lack of a platform to share their receipes. They tried using text messages but found it very hard to keep track of and hard to view. Not to mention, each family's receipes are for different amounts of people so it's very hard to accurate gauge how much ingredients is needed for multiple servings. Credibility is also a question my client noticed. (Evidence of consultation in Appendix 1)

## Proposed Solution

Considering the client's requirements, an adequate solution would be social-media styled website that can store data
inside a database. The most common tools for web development are Javascript, HTML, CSS[^8]but Javascript is a
client-side language, which means that code is executed on the user's browser. This can burden the client's computer with heavy tasks. To remedy this, Python would be an adequate programming language for more heavy tasks in the web application as it is not a client-side language, open sourced, mature and excels at memory management[^2]. As for the choice of web server framework, Flask would be an adequate choice as it is the scale of the website isn't so large that it requires more sophisticated frameworks like Django, making it fit to the client's need for a school use website without overcomplicating resources[^3][^9].For the database, SQLite would be a good fit as the data we are fitting is not very large and SQLite, with its embedded,serverless nature[^4], can reduce the use of computing resources while running the website, not to mention higher speeds. To interface with database, the SQLAlchemy is the prefered interface layer as it has performance advantages and is protected against security attacks such as SQL injections[^5]. As for the user interface for the website, Bootstrap 5 is recommended for its dynamic scaling abilities to scale automatically for different devices[^6].To keep the website and their users secure, JSON web tokens are used because they are resistant to security attacks[^7]

### Design statement

I will design a social media platform on a website built with Flask, HTML, and CSS which stores data in an
SQLite database for my client. This website will allow my client to post receipes and ingredients of
them accordingly, with a comment system to provide feedback. It will take approximately 2 months to complete and
will be evaluated according to the criteria below:

## Success Criteria

1. The website must allow user registration for personal accounts secured*(Issue tackled: "Credibility is also a question my client noticed" and "found it very hard to keep track of")*
2. The website must allow for posting of recipes and their respective details *(Issue tackled: "there is a lack of a platform to share their receipes.")*
3. The webiste must allow for commenting on each recipe posted  *(Issue tackled: "very hard to keep track of")*
4. The website must allow for calculating the amount of ingredients needed based on user input *(Issue tackled: "it's very hard to accurate gauge how much ingredients is needed for multiple servings.")*
5. The website would allow putting picture on each posted receipe*(Issue tackled:"They tried using text messages but found it very hard to keep track of and hard to view.")*
6. The website would allow searching for recipes with the ingredients *(Issue tackled:"They tried using text messages but found it very hard to keep track of and hard to view.")*
7. The website would allow for exporting the recipe to a PDF  *(Issue tackled: "very hard to keep track of")*

# Criteria B: Design

## System Diagram

![](Assets/SysD3.jpeg)

**Fig.1** *System diagram of the Website* This diagram shows the system design of the RecipeShare social media. This system design consists of two main parts. The first part is the flask server on top. In my case, I'm using a server running macOS. This server houses the flask application inside a Python virtual environment. This server also holds the SQLite database which is responsible for storing user data. The client, on the bottom, connects to the server on a browser through the internet with HTTP `GET` and `POST` requests. The user inputs data using the keyboard and trackpad or mouse and the output is displayed on the screen.

## Data Storage

<img src="Assets/RecipeShare_ER2.jpeg" style="zoom: 50%;" />

**Fig.2** *ER diagram of the Website* This diagram shows the relational database strcuture design for this social media. As users are the core of the service, every other database column has some form of connection back to the `User` table. In my design, the user writes `Recipes` and `Comments`. In which `Recipes` have `Ingredients` in them as the number of ingredients is unpredictable to the system and that would be the most logical way to normalize the database.

### Example of Data Entries

## UML Diagram

**Fig.7** *UML Diagram of the website* This diagram showcases the different classes I used to group together functions I use through the program. My classes are separated into two sections. One for interacting with the database(the part in green). And two for doing authentication management(the part in blue). This is utilizing the Object-Oriented Programming structure to reduce boilerplate code and provide a level of abstraction on the main server program.

## Wireframe

## Development

### JSON Web Tokens (Success Criteria #1)

One of the success criteria was to have a hashed login system. I tried to use cookies as it can be easily retreived by the backend when needed and takes up little system resources. However, I realized after that cookies can be easily modified on the client's side. Thus I turned to session tokens. Session token are basically a hash created when the user successfully logs in and is the pass the user holds to perform previleged actions on the website. They expire after a designated time and is hashed using a special secret key. Currently, once the user successfully logs in with the right username and password, the main function on the flask endpoint executes a `create_token` function from the `token_management.py`. The token is created as follows:

```py
# This functions takes in the username and the how long the token should last in minutes
def create_token(username, token_duration):
    # This adjusts the starting time of counting the token expiry to keep consistency across different platforms
    unix_timestamp = (datetime.now() - datetime(1970, 1, 1)).total_seconds()
    # This line sets the expiry time of the token
    ttl = token_duration * 60 + unix_timestamp
    # token format = encoded(username, datetime) token_duration in minutes
    token = jwt.encode({'username': username, 'datetime': ttl}, token_encryption_key, algorithm='HS256')
    # Token is returned to the main flask function
    return token
```

After the main function receives the token from the `create_token` function, its gives the token back to the client by
putting it into the session variable of the browser as follows:

```py
session['token'] = create_token(username, 120)
```

Now, the user holds the token in their browser. When they want to execute an action, the backend tries to get the token
from the browser as follows:

```py
@app.route("/recipe/<int:recipe_id>")
def recipe(recipe_id):
    # Check if the token exists in the session
    token = session.get('token')
    if token and check_token(token):
        #Continues Function
    else:
      #If either the token doesnt exist or it is expired when checked against the key, the user is returned to the login screen.
    	return redirect(url_for('login'))
```

On the code above, I used the `try` statement to handle `KeyError` in the instance that the JWT is not present in the
user's browser and redirects them to the login page. If the token is present, the validity of it is checked using
a `check_token` function. It decodes the token and checks if the expiry time has exceeded current time as follows:

```py
def check_token(token): # check if token is valid and not expired
    try:
        # Decodes token using predefined key and algorithm
        decoded_token = jwt.decode(token, token_encryption_key, algorithms=['HS256'])
        current_time = datetime.utcnow().timestamp()
        # Compares expiry time and current time
        if decoded_token['datetime'] < current_time:
            return False
        else:
            return True
    except Exception:
        return False
```

The main function then receives a boolean value of whether the user is valid in an active session and lets them proceed with the desired action accordingly. This system closes the loophole of modifying cookies and completes the hashed authentication system criteria.

### Ingredients Storage(Success Criteria #2)

My client needed to be able to post recipes and their respective details in an organized way. While designing the system for that, I noticed a problem. That is that there would only be one column for ingredients inside the table but there would be a different number of ingredients inputted by the user. To resolve this, I chose to use another table of the database.

![](Assets/JS_Showcase.jpg)

**Fig.11**  *Screenshot showing the section for inputting ingredients. In my implementation, on the client side, they are able to easily add text fields to the form they are typing in. This is achieved through JS on the client side. When the user clicks the `Add Item` button, it triggers the javascript to create a new set of elements for a new ingridient. When the user clicks the `delete` button, it removes the set of elements from the HTML. Allowing the user to dynamically adjust the form to the needs of their recipe.*

```javascript
document.getElementById('addInputBtn').addEventListener('click', function () {
    //Code omitted for defining the UI elements
    // Add the input, dropdown, and remove button to the new div
    newDiv.appendChild(newInput);
    newDiv.appendChild(newInput2);
    newDiv.appendChild(newDropdown);
    newDiv.appendChild(removeBtn);
    // Add the new div to the form
    document.getElementById('newInputs').appendChild(newDiv);
});
```

When a user submits a form, it is done through a `POST` request. The flask application then collects the information for the ingredients' name, amount and unit separately and zips them into a list along with collecting other information for the form as shown below:

```py
if request.method == 'POST':
    title = request.form.get('title')
    content = request.form.get('content')
    #Ingredients' names, amounts, and units are collected separately
    ingredient_names = request.form.getlist('ingredient_name[]')
    ingredient_amounts = request.form.getlist('ingredient_amount[]')
    ingredient_units = request.form.getlist('ingredient_unit[]')
		#All three elements are zipped into a list.
    ingredients = zip(ingredient_names, ingredient_amounts, ingredient_units)
```

After collecting the raw information from the user, the zipped list is put into dictionary as shown below

```python
ingredients_dict_list = [
                {
                    "name": ingredient_name,
                    "amount": ingredient_amount,
                    "unit": need_description
                }
                for ingredient_name, ingredient_amount, need_description in ingredients
            ]
```

The dictionary is then passed through to the `create_post` function in the database handler class. This function firsts creates the recipe by doing:

```python
#Creates new Recipe object
new_post = Recipe(name=title, content=content, image=unique_filename, user_id=user_id)
#Add the newly created object to the already-opened session
self.session.add(new_post)
#Commit the changes
self.session.commit()
```

Notice that we haven't passed through the ingredients but we have commited the changes already. That is because the ingredients require the recipe `id` as a foreign key so we cannot commit the changes at the same time as we would not know what `id` would be assigned to that recipe before commiting the changes. Thus after this, a for loop is used to loop through each item in the dictionary to add them to the database:

```python
for ingredient in ingredients_dictionary:
  new_ingredient = Ingredients(name=ingredient["name"], amount=ingredient["amount"], unit=ingredient["unit"], recipe_id=new_post.id)
  self.session.add(new_ingredient)
  #After this we do another commit to the database using 
  self.session.commit()
```

When it comes time to retrieve the data,the server requests the `recipe` by id. Which then the database handler queries the database for the recipe and the ingredients separately:

```python
#Database handler receives id as input
def get_one_post(self, id):
  	#Recipe table is queried by id
    recipe =  self.session.query(Recipe).filter_by(id=id).first()
    #Ingredients table is queried by id
    ingredients = self.session.query(Ingredients).filter_by(recipe_id=id).all()
    #List is returned with username of poster as well as the other information being queried
    return [recipe,self.session.query(Users).filter_by(id=temp.user_id).first().username,ingredients]
```

The flask application then passes the list to the html file and the `jinja2` logic creates the ingridients by column automatically.

![](Assets/ingredients_eg.jpg)

**Fig.12**  *Screenshot showing the ingredients part when a user loads up a recipe*

### Commenting System(Success Criteria #3)

My client specifically requested for the ability to comment on recipes. To achieve that, I used a separate table on the database with a foreign key that links back to the recipe. As a recipe is represented in the way of a card, I added the comments section to the footer of the card with the `card-footer`class as shown below:

```html
<div class="card-footer">
  <div class="comments-section">
      <h4>Comments</h4>
      {% if comments %}
          <ul class="list-group">
          {% for comment in comments %}
					<!--Code Omitted for demonstrative purpose-->
          {% endfor %}
      {% else %}
          <p>No comments yet.</p>
      {% endif %}
      </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="add-comment-form">
<!--Code Omitted for demonstrative purpose-->
  </div>
</div>
```

As you can see, when the recipe is loaded,the database is queried for comments with the same id in the foreign key. After the results of that query is passed through to the HTML, I used jinja2's loop function to create a section for each comment made, showing the author and the content of the comment.

![](Assets/Comments.jpg)

**Fig.13**  *Screenshot showing the section for comments. To post a comment, the user would put the comment in the textbox and press `Post Comment`. That will trigger a form submission into the flask application and it would be processed with a function.*



```python
def add_comment(recipe_id):
    #Collects session token from browser
    token = session.get('token')
    #Checks token validity
    if token and check_token(token):
      #Unpacks token
        username = get_username_from_token(token)
        #Collects form input
        comment_content = request.form.get('comment_content')
        #Passes through information to database handler
        db.add_comment_to_recipe(recipe_id, username, comment_content)
        return redirect(url_for('recipe', recipe_id=recipe_id))
    return redirect(url_for('login'))
```



### Serving Calculations(Success Criteria #4)

My client also requested for the ability to calculate the amounts of ingredients needed to make the number of servings inputted by the user. As when the recipe is created, the user is asked to input the ingredients in a systematic manner as seen in **Fig.11**. I chose to use Javascript on the HTML.  To achieve this, I first created a counter object in HTML as shown below:

![](Assets/ServingCounter.jpg)

**Fig.14**  *Screenshot showing the counter for adjusting the number of servings*

This counter above is created by using the `input_group` class in Bootstrap to group the buttons and the text display together as shown:

```html
<div class="input-group mb-3" style="width: 200px">
    <button class="btn btn-secondary" type="button" id="minusButton">-</button>
    <input type="text" id="servingInput" value="1" readonly
           class="form-control text-center">
    <button class="btn btn-secondary" type="button" id="plusButton">+</button>
</div>
```

As seen, the first line defines the holder for group of elements, followed by the buttons and text fields being defined. These buttons are handled by a javascript function. This function first defines three internal variables to collect information from the form.

```javascript
const servingInput = document.getElementById('servingInput');
const minusButton = document.getElementById('minusButton');
const plusButton = document.getElementById('plusButton');
```

These lines define variables to allow the javascript to interact with the data in HTML. After that, the script continues by creating the `updateIngredients()` function. 

```javascript
// This function updates the displayed ingredient amounts
function updateIngredients() {
    // Parses the serving size entered by the user as an integer
    const servings = parseInt(servingInput.value, 10);
    // Selects all ingredient list items and loops over them
    document.querySelectorAll('#ingredientList li').forEach(function (ingredientItem) {
        // Retrieves the base amount of the ingredient from the 'data-amount' attribute and converts it to a float
        const baseAmount = parseFloat(ingredientItem.getAttribute('data-amount'));
        // Retrieves the unit of measurement for the ingredient from the 'data-unit' attribute
        const unit = ingredientItem.getAttribute('data-unit');
        // Calculates the new amount needed for the specified number of servings
        const newAmount = baseAmount * servings;
        // Updates the text content of the ingredient amount on the page, rounding to two decimal places
        ingredientItem.querySelector('.ingredientAmount').textContent = newAmount.toFixed(2) + ' ' + unit;
    });
}
```

This function is called whenever there is a need to update the ingredient amounts. It is wired to respond to user interactions with the serving size counter. Continuing with the event listeners:

```javascript
// Event listener for the minus button
minusButton.addEventListener('click', function () {
    // Get the current value from the serving input as an integer
    const currentValue = parseInt(servingInput.value, 10);
    // Check if the current value is greater than the minimum allowed servings (1 in this case)
    if (currentValue > 1) {
        // Decrement the serving count
        servingInput.value = currentValue - 1;
        // Update the ingredient amounts to reflect the new number of servings
        updateIngredients();
    }
});
//Code for the plus button event listener is omitted because of similarity
```

These event listeners monitor clicks on the minus and plus buttons. When the minus button is clicked, it checks if the serving size is above the minimum and, if so, decreases the serving count and updates the ingredient amounts and vice versa. 

### Pictures on Recipes/File Uploads(Success Criteria #5)

One of the key functions my client mentioned was the capability for users to upload images. To achieve this feature, we first declare a few variables:

```python
#Directory where all the uploaded images will be stored is declared
UPLOAD_FOLDER = 'uploads'
#A set of allowed extensions is declared
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'png', 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'gif'}
#The Flask app is then configured to reference this upload folder
app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'] = UPLOAD_FOLDER
```

Furthermore, to reliably handle the file path regardless of the operating system, we use `os.path` functions to construct an absolute path to the uploads directory:

```python
BASE_DIR = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..'))
UPLOADS_PATH = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'uploads')
```

The next step in the process is the implementation of a  gatekeeper to determine if the uploaded file's extension is within our defined set in order to prevent malicious files:

```python
def allowed_file(filename):
    return '.' in filename and filename.rsplit('.', 1)[1].lower() in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS
```

This function first checks if a file extension in present. If a file extension is present, it will be extracted in the second part of the return function and checked against the list of `ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS`. If both conditions are met, then the function would return TRUE. With the preparatory work in place, the logic for handling an uploaded image is straightforward. 

```python
#File is being put into variable when form is submitted
uploaded_file = request.files.get('uploaded_image')
```

It undergoes a series of checks—firstly, to ascertain that there is indeed a file and that it has a filename, then to validate the file type using our `allowed_file` function. If these checks are passed, the file is saved with a unique timestamped filename to avoid overwriting any existing files:

```python
if uploaded_file and uploaded_file.filename != '':
    if allowed_file(uploaded_file.filename):
        # Generate unique filename using timestamp
        unique_filename = f"{int(time.time())}_{uploaded_file.filename}"
        filepath = os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], unique_filename)
        uploaded_file.save(filepath)
        print(f"Image saved as: {filepath}")
    else:
        print("Invalid file type.")
        return "Invalid file type.", 400
else:
    unique_filename = "No file"
```

The last part is incorporating this filename into the database entry for the new recipe post, ensuring that the image can be referenced and displayed alongside the recipe content. When a user loads the dashboard or a specific recipe, the browser will request the image from the `/uploads/` endpoint. To handle this, a flask endpoint is in place to serve the images from their absolute paths to the browser:

```python
@app.route('/uploads/<filename>')
def uploaded_file(filename):
    return send_from_directory(UPLOADS_PATH, filename)
```

This allows easy loading of the pictures uploaded and completes the success criteria.

### Search Function(Success Criteria #6)

My client wanted search functionality for their recipe-sharing platform. To initiate a search, the user would click the `Search` button on the header of the webpage. There, a search box would appear on a new page. The user would enter their keyword for query and click `Search` again to submit their query. The backend handles this input using the following Flask route:

```python
if request.method == 'POST':
  #user's search input, referred to as `search_query`, is retrieved from the form data.
    search_query = request.form.get('search_query')
    #search query is passed on to a method in the database manager
    posts = db.search(search_query)
    return render_template('search.html', username=username, search_results=posts)
```

 The `search` function interacts with the underlying SQL Database using SQLAlchemy.

```python
def search(self, search_query):
    # This line queries the Recipe table, using a LIKE SQL clause to find matches
    temp = self.session.query(Recipe).filter(Recipe.name.like("%"+search_query+"%")).all()
    posts = []
    # Looping through each matched recipe
    for post in temp:
        # Appending a combination of recipe information and the username of the poster
        posts.append([post, self.session.query(Users).filter_by(id=post.user_id).first().username])
        #list of search results is then passed back to the Flask route
    return posts
```

The render_template generates the HTML output after the code. The search results are packaged into a context dictionary that the search.html template uses to display the information on the web page.

### PDF Downloads(Success Criteria #7)

My client wanted the ability to download recipe as PDFs. This is done by a rendering engine in the server. First and foremost, there is definitely a download button on the recipe page. 

```html
<a href="/recipe/download/{{ recipe.id }}/"><button class="btn btn-primary" type="button" id="downloadRecipe">Download Recipe</button></a>
```

Then, I resorted to use client-side javascript to tell the client's browser to print the screen with the following code:

```html
<button class="btn btn-primary" type="button" onclick="window.print()">Print Recipe</button>
```

When this button is clicked, the javascript calls back to  the `print()` function inside the window object to trigger the browser to print the page.

# Criteria E: Evaluation

## Evaluation by Client

| Success Criteria                                             | Met? | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The website must allow user registration for personal accounts secured with a token system | Yes  | Users are secured behind a hashed login system and token system |
| The website must allow for posting of recipes and their respective details | Yes  | The website allows for posting new content via the `new_post/` endpoint |
| The website must allow for commenting on each recipe posted  | Yes  | This website allows for commenting on each recipe with the comments section under each post and the `add_comment` endpoint |
| The website must allow for calculating the amount of ingredients needed based on the number of serving inputted by the user | Yes  | The website allows for calculating the amount based on the inputted number with client-side Javascript |
| The website must allow putting picture on each posted recipe | Yes  | The website allows for posting pictrues alongside posts with the `add_post` endpoint |
| The website must allow searching for recipes                 | Yes  | The website allows for search through the social media a dedicated `/search` page |
| The website must allow for exporting the recipe in PDF form  | Yes  | The website allows for exporting to PDF using client-side Javascript |

## Evaluation by Peer

My peer is very satisfied by the product(See Appendix 4), with the website meeting all the success criteria. One possible improvement highlighted by my peer was the ability to add subheadings to the posts.

## Extensibility

The client was very satisfied with the final result. After some additional discussion,
we concluded that the following future extensions could be added:

| Improvement                            | Notes                                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Photo Enlargement during export to PDF | This can be done to make the photo easier to see in the printout. This can be achieved easily using a html tag instructing the browser to render the image larger on load |
| Subheading in main text                | This can be done to make the recipe easier to read and follow along with. This can be achieved by adding tools to indicate headings when creating posts and adding logic to interpret those signs during render. |
